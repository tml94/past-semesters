%Complete the following problems:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Calculate the difference quotient $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ for\\ $f(x)=3x^2+5$. \begin{solution}
%			\textcolor{blue}{First we solve $f(x+h)$, by substituting $x+h$ into $f(x)$ wherever we see an $x$: \begin{align*} f(x+h) &= 3(x+h)^2+5\\ &=3(x^2+2xh+h^2)+5\\ &= 3x^2+6xh+3h^2+5 \end{align*} Next we solve $f(x+h)-f(x)$: \begin{align*} f(x+h)-f(x) &= 3x^2+6xh+3h^2+5- (3x^2+5)\\ &= 3x^2+6xh+3h^2-3x^2-5\\ &= 3h^2+6xh\end{align*} Finally we take the above solution to $f(x+h)-f(x)$ and divide by $h$: \begin{align*} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} &= \frac{3h^2+6xh}{h}\\ &= 3h+6x \end{align*} This gives us the final answer of $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=3h+6x$. }

%\section*{Things you need to know about inverse functions}
%When does a function have an inverse function?\\ %\textit{A function is invertible if it is one-to-one, every output variable has exactly one input variable. Graphically it must pass the horizontal line test}

%How do you find an inverse function, for a function that has one?\\ %\textit{Solve for the input variable as a function of the output variable}

%	
%	Identify the:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Horizontal Asymptote: 
%			\begin{solution}
%				\textcolor{blue}{Since the degree in the denominator is bigger than the degree in the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$.This can also be seen in the graph above.}
%			\end{solution}
%		\item Vertical Asymptote(s):
%			\begin{solution}
%				\textcolor{blue}{To find the vertical asymptotes, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$. That is
%				\begin{align*}
%					0 &= x^2+8x+12\\
%					&=(x+2)(x+6)\\
%				\end{align*}
%				This implies that there are vertical asymptotes at $x=-6$ and $x=-2$. This can also be seen in the graph of the function above.}
%			\end{solution}
%		\item Zeros of the function
%			\begin{solution}
%				\textcolor{blue}{To find the zeros we set the numerator equal to $0$ and solve. That is we have $0=-12$. This does not make sense which implies this function has no zeros.}
%			\end{solution}
%		\item $y$-intercept
%			\begin{solution}
%				\textcolor{blue}{The $y$-intercept occurs when we plug in 0 for $x$ and simplify. We see that
%				\begin{align*}
%					f(0) &= \frac{-12}{0^2+8(0)+12}\\
%					&=\frac{-12}{0+0+12}\\

\begin{problem}
	A cup of coffee that is initially $125^\circ$F is placed in a room kept at a constant $72^\circ$F. The temperature of the coffee, $T$ as a function of time is given by $T(x)=72+53(0.8)^x$, where $x$ is measured in minutes. How long will it take the coffee to cool to $100^\circ$F?

\begin{problem}
	A radioactive isotope of bismuth has a half-life of $5$ days. After how many days will 20\% of the isotope remain?
\end{problem}



\begin{problem}
	The world population has been growing roughly exponentially for the past 30 years. In 1987, the world population was approximately 5 billion. In 1998, the world population was approximately 6 billion. Find an exponential equation of the form $y=Ce^{kt}$ which models the population with $t$ representing the number of years 1987. Use at least 6 decimal places for the value of $k$. What does the model predict the population was in 2000?

\begin{problem}
	The doubling time for an investment is given by the equation $T=\frac{\ln(2)}{\ln(1+r)}$ where $r$ is the interest rate in decimal form. At what interest rate would you need to invest in order to double your investment in 10 years?

\begin{problem}
	Suppose after 2500 years an initial amount of 1000 grams of radioactive substance has decayed to 75 grams. What is the half-life of the substance?

\begin{problem}
	The concentration of a pollutant in the atmosphere increases according to the exponential growth model $A=Pe^{rt}$, where time is measured in years and $r=0.0035$. In 1990, the concentration was 56 parts per million. Clean-up procedures will be initiated when the concentration reaches 70 parts per million. According to the model, in what year will that occur?

\begin{problem}
	Air pressure, $P$, decreases exponentially with the height above the surface of the earth. At the top of Mount Everest, height 8848 meters, the air pressure is about 34.6\% of the air pressure at sea level. Approximate the air pressure as a percentage of the sea level value at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, height 5895 meters.

\begin{problem}
	A pork roast is removed from the freezer ($25^\circ$F) and placed in a room ($75^\circ$F). The number of minutes it takes the temperature of the roast to reach $x$ degrees F is given by the formula $T=f(x)=\frac{100}{3}\ln\left(\frac{50}{75-x}\right)$. Find and interpret $f^{-1}(70)$.

\begin{problem}
	New employees are given an initial exam and then retested monthly with an equivalent exam. The average scores for the employees can be expressed as $S(t)=76-6\cdot \log_{3}(t+1)$ where $t$ is measured in months since the initial exam. After approximately how many months would the average score be 54?
